This repo was created to fix the https://iscd.huji.ac.il/data database using R code. 

The database inclueds some records with commas, a problem whan using the CSV and potentially a problem when analyzing with other software. 

The excel files "iscd_cases_2018-12-05.xlsx" and "iscd_judges_2018-12-05.xlsx" were downloaded from https://iscd.huji.ac.il/data and the code in the "read_excel.R" file was run. The resulting files are "cases_fix.xlsx".

This vesion has fixed the cases and judges tabels. But it does not include a CSV file.
